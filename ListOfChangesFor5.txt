* Metadata key changed from string to object, to allow for use of typeof() as metadata key

* Export Type Set changed Select to Where

* IExportStrategy was replaced with ICompiledExportStrategy

* ILifestyle was replaced with ICompiledLifestyle

* InjectionContext broken into two different types, StaticInjectionContext (information known at configuration time) and InjectionContext per object graph context object

* IExportLocator -> IExportLocatorScope taking over more functionality from IInjectionScope

* ILocatorService was inroduced it defines all Locate methods without the complexity of IExportLocatorScope, it's recommend you inject this instead of IExportLocatorScope

* BeingLifetimeScope -> IExportLocatorScope instead of IInjectionScope

* IInjectionScope won't inject by default, more than likely you want IExportLocatorScope

* Removed Named - this will be an add on after the fact rather than part of the core functionality. 

* Conditions are tested once at resolution time rather than every time an export is located, runtime conditions can be implemented as ExportFactory

* When____ moved to When.______ this was to clean up the interface

---------- Improvements

* Decorators are now supported

* Custom Wrappers are supported 

* Override IEnumerable creation

* ExportFactory - allows the developer to export a method with dependencies injected to arguments

* Export Method - you can now export a method of a type

* Performance - object graphs are now calculated completely at first location. This allows it to operate as fast or faster than all other containers
